I started my career with a bachelor's degree in economics, which gave me a strong foundation in data analysis and business understanding.\n\nOver the years, I've specialized in the Microsoft Power Platform ecosystem, particularly Power BI, Power Query, and DAX. I've led several major projects including:\n‚Ä¢ Converting legacy Tableau dashboards to Power BI, improving performance by 30%\n‚Ä¢ Building enterprise-scale data models serving 500+ users\n‚Ä¢ Implementing automated ETL processes using Power Query and SQL\n‚Ä¢ Creating self-service analytics solutions that reduced manual reporting by 60%\n\nI'm particularly drawn to this role because it combines my technical skills in Power BI with the opportunity to work on meaningful government transformation projects. I enjoy the challenge of turning complex data into actionable insights that drive real business decisions."

What particularly draws me to AGR is your approach of being a transformation partner rather than just a technology vendor - you focus on solving real business problems, not just implementing technology for its own sake.\n\nI'm particularly interested in government and federal work because:\n‚Ä¢ The structured requirements and compliance considerations push me to build robust, maintainable systems\n‚Ä¢ The scale and impact of public sector projects means my work directly benefits citizens and government operations\n‚Ä¢ The complexity of legacy systems and data integration challenges align perfectly with my Power BI and data modeling expertise\n\nThis role specifically matches my strengths - converting legacy dashboards, using Power Platform tools, and working full-stack. I believe I can contribute immediately while growing into more leadership responsibilities within these high-stakes, high-impact engagements."

This created confusion during executive meetings when different departments presented conflicting data.\n\nTASK: I was given ownership to consolidate and migrate all departmental dashboards into a unified Power BI platform while ensuring data accuracy, performance, and stakeholder buy-in.\n\nACTION:\n‚Ä¢ Conducted discovery sessions with each unit to understand KPIs, definitions, and data sources\n‚Ä¢ Designed a canonical data model using star schema in SQL to unify the backend structure\n‚Ä¢ Built ETL pipelines using Power Query with error handling and staging layers\n‚Ä¢ Implemented parameter-driven filtering and optimized DAX measures using variables to reduce scan costs\n‚Ä¢ Set up incremental refresh with monthly partitions to reduce load times\n‚Ä¢ Rolled out dashboards gradually with feedback cycles and user training\n\nRESULT:\n‚Ä¢ All units migrated to Power BI within 3 months\n‚Ä¢ Refresh failures dropped by 60% and report load times improved by 30%\n‚Ä¢ Stakeholders appreciated the consistency and self-service capabilities\n‚Ä¢ Reduced manual reporting time by 40% across all departments"

Features include:\n  - Connect to various data sources (SQL Server, Excel, APIs, etc.)\n  - Transform data using Power Query (M language)\n  - Build data models and create relationships\n  - Write DAX measures and calculated columns\n  - Design interactive visuals and reports\n\n‚Ä¢ POWER BI SERVICE (PowerBI.com): The cloud platform for:\n  - Publishing and sharing reports and dashboards\n  - Scheduling data refreshes\n  - Managing workspaces and app distribution\n  - Setting up row-level security (RLS)\n  - Collaboration and commenting\n\n‚Ä¢ POWER BI GATEWAY: Enables secure connection between on-premises data sources and Power BI Service, handling live and scheduled refreshes.\n\n‚Ä¢ POWER BI DATAFLOWS: Reusable ETL pipelines in the service that standardize data preparation and enable data reuse across multiple reports.\n\n‚Ä¢ DATASETS, REPORTS, DASHBOARDS: The core artifacts where datasets provide the data model, reports contain multi-page visuals, and dashboards pin key visuals for executive views."

KEY DAX FUNCTIONS I USE FREQUENTLY:

1. CALCULATE() - Modifies filter context
   Example: Sales East = CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]), Sales[Region] = "East")
   Use case: Creating conditional calculations, time intelligence

2. SUMX() - Iterates over a table and sums an expression
   Example: Total Margin = SUMX(Sales, Sales[Amount] * Sales[Margin%])
   Use case: Row-by-row calculations that need to be aggregated

3. ALL() / REMOVEFILTERS() - Ignores or resets filters
   Example: % of Total = DIVIDE(SUM(Sales[Amount]), CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]), ALL(Sales)))
   Use case: Creating percentage calculations, comparative metrics

4. FILTER() - Applies row-level conditional logic
   Example: High Value Sales = CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]), FILTER(Sales, Sales[Amount] > 1000))
   Use case: Complex filtering conditions

5. RELATED() - Retrieves values from related tables
   Example: Customer Name = RELATED(Customers[Name])
   Use case: Bringing in dimension attributes to fact tables

BEST PRACTICES:
‚Ä¢ Use VAR to store intermediate calculations for clarity and performance
‚Ä¢ Combine functions for complex business logic

                a: "Performance optimization is critical for user experience. Here's my systematic approach:

MODEL OPTIMIZATION:
‚Ä¢ Remove unused columns and tables to reduce model size
‚Ä¢ Use appropriate data types (Integer vs Text, Date vs DateTime)
‚Ä¢ Reduce cardinality by grouping or categorizing high-cardinality columns
‚Ä¢ Use aggregations for large fact tables when detail isn't always needed
‚Ä¢ Implement incremental refresh for large datasets

DAX OPTIMIZATION:
‚Ä¢ Use VAR variables to avoid repeated calculations
‚Ä¢ Break complex expressions into smaller, readable parts
‚Ä¢ Avoid nested iterators (SUMX inside SUMX)
‚Ä¢ Use measures instead of calculated columns when possible
‚Ä¢ Leverage query folding in Power Query

VISUAL OPTIMIZATION:
‚Ä¢ Limit the number of visuals on each page (aim for <10)
‚Ä¢ Avoid complex custom visuals when standard ones suffice
‚Ä¢ Use appropriate chart types for data density
‚Ä¢ Implement lazy loading for large datasets
‚Ä¢ Minimize cross-filtering between visuals

DATA SOURCE OPTIMIZATION:
‚Ä¢ Enable query folding in Power Query
‚Ä¢ Use DirectQuery only when real-time data is essential
‚Ä¢ Optimize source queries with proper indexing
‚Ä¢ Use composite models strategically

MONITORING:
‚Ä¢ Use Performance Analyzer to identify bottlenecks
‚Ä¢ Monitor refresh times and query performance
‚Ä¢ Set up alerts for failed refreshes
‚Ä¢ Regular performance reviews with stakeholders"

                a: "Row-Level Security (RLS) restricts which rows of data users can see based on their identity or role, ensuring data is filtered according to business rules.

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:

1. DEFINE ROLES in Power BI Desktop:
   ‚Ä¢ Go to Model view ‚Üí Security
   ‚Ä¢ Create roles (e.g., "Regional Manager", "Department Head")
   ‚Ä¢ Write DAX filter expressions for each role

2. WRITE DAX FILTERS:
   ‚Ä¢ Use USERNAME() or USERPRINCIPALNAME() functions
   ‚Ä¢ Example: Sales[Region] = USERNAME()
   ‚Ä¢ For complex scenarios, reference security tables

3. ASSIGN USERS in Power BI Service:
   ‚Ä¢ Publish the dataset with RLS enabled
   ‚Ä¢ Go to dataset settings ‚Üí Security
   ‚Ä¢ Add users/security groups to appropriate roles

4. TEST THOROUGHLY:
   ‚Ä¢ Use "View as Role" in Desktop to test
   ‚Ä¢ Validate with different user accounts
   ‚Ä¢ Test edge cases (users with multiple roles)

ADVANCED PATTERNS:
‚Ä¢ Use security tables for complex mappings
‚Ä¢ Implement dynamic security based on user attributes
‚Ä¢ Handle many-to-many relationships carefully
‚Ä¢ Consider performance impact on large datasets

COMMON USE CASES:
‚Ä¢ Regional data access (sales reps see only their region)
‚Ä¢ Department-level security (HR sees only their department)
‚Ä¢ Customer data isolation (partners see only their data)
‚Ä¢ Compliance requirements (GDPR, SOX, etc.)"

                a: "When a scheduled refresh fails, I follow a systematic diagnostic process:

IMMEDIATE TROUBLESHOOTING:
1. Check the error message in Power BI Service:
   ‚Ä¢ Go to dataset settings ‚Üí Scheduled refresh
   ‚Ä¢ Review the specific error details
   ‚Ä¢ Common errors: credential failures, gateway issues, data source changes

2. Verify gateway status:
   ‚Ä¢ Check if the gateway is online and running
   ‚Ä¢ Verify credentials haven't expired
   ‚Ä¢ Test gateway connectivity to data sources

3. Test data source connectivity:
   ‚Ä¢ Verify server names, credentials, and firewall rules
   ‚Ä¢ Check if data source is accessible
   ‚Ä¢ Test with a simple query first

SYSTEMATIC DEBUGGING:
4. Isolate the failing component:
   ‚Ä¢ Test each query/table individually in Power BI Desktop
   ‚Ä¢ Check for recent changes (schema, columns, data types)
   ‚Ä¢ Verify query folding is working properly

5. Check for data issues:
   ‚Ä¢ Look for schema changes in source systems
   ‚Ä¢ Verify data quality and completeness
   ‚Ä¢ Check for new data that breaks transformations

6. Performance optimization:
   ‚Ä¢ Break large queries into smaller chunks
   ‚Ä¢ Implement incremental refresh if appropriate
   ‚Ä¢ Add error handling in Power Query

COMMUNICATION & PREVENTION:
7. Notify stakeholders immediately about delays
8. Document root cause and solution
9. Set up monitoring and alerts for future failures
10. Implement retry logic and better error handling

EXAMPLE: Once had a server name change that broke multiple table refreshes. I identified the failing tables, updated connection strings, and restored full refresh within 2 hours."

CONVERSION STRATEGY:

1. DISCOVERY & MAPPING:
   ‚Ä¢ Document each Tableau visualization's purpose and data requirements
   ‚Ä¢ Map Tableau calculated fields to DAX measures
   ‚Ä¢ Identify data sources and connection methods
   ‚Ä¢ Document filters, parameters, and interactions

2. DATA MODEL REDESIGN:
   ‚Ä¢ Often rebuild the data model using star schema principles
   ‚Ä¢ Normalize dimensions and optimize relationships
   ‚Ä¢ Remove redundancy and improve performance
   ‚Ä¢ Implement proper data types and hierarchies

3. MEASURE CONVERSION:
   ‚Ä¢ Convert Tableau calculated fields to DAX measures
   ‚Ä¢ Handle LOD (Level of Detail) expressions carefully
   ‚Ä¢ Recreate window functions using DAX patterns
   ‚Ä¢ Test calculations with sample data for accuracy

Power Query is the data transformation and connection tool in Power BI, using the M language for data preparation and ETL processes.

POWER QUERY (M LANGUAGE) - DATA PREPARATION:
‚Ä¢ Purpose: Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) operations
‚Ä¢ When it runs: During data refresh/loading
‚Ä¢ Use cases:
  - Connecting to data sources
  - Data cleaning and transformation
  - Merging and appending tables
  - Pivoting and unpivoting data
  - Data type conversions
  - Filtering and sorting

DAX - ANALYTICS & CALCULATIONS:
‚Ä¢ Purpose: Business logic and analytics calculations
‚Ä¢ When it runs: At query time (when visuals are rendered)
‚Ä¢ Use cases:
  - Creating measures and KPIs
  - Calculated columns
  - Time intelligence functions
  - Complex business logic
  - Dynamic calculations based on context

KEY DIFFERENCES:
‚Ä¢ TIMING: M runs during refresh, DAX runs during queries
‚Ä¢ CONTEXT: M works row-by-row, DAX works with filter context
‚Ä¢ PURPOSE: M for data prep, DAX for analytics
‚Ä¢ PERFORMANCE: M affects refresh time, DAX affects query performance

BEST PRACTICE: Use Power Query for as much data transformation as possible, keeping the data model lean and using DAX for business logic that needs to respond to user interactions."

IMPORT MODE:
‚Ä¢ How it works: Data is imported and stored in the Power BI model
‚Ä¢ Performance: Fastest for visuals and interactions
‚Ä¢ DAX support: Full DAX functionality available
‚Ä¢ Limitations: Dataset size limits (1GB for Pro, 100GB for Premium)
‚Ä¢ Refresh: Requires scheduled refreshes
‚Ä¢ Best for: Most scenarios, especially when performance is critical

DIRECTQUERY MODE:
‚Ä¢ How it works: Queries are sent live to the data source
‚Ä¢ Performance: Depends on source system performance
‚Ä¢ DAX support: Limited DAX functions (no calculated columns)
‚Ä¢ Limitations: Slower visuals, limited transformations
‚Ä¢ Refresh: Real-time data (no refresh needed)
‚Ä¢ Best for: Large datasets, real-time requirements

LIVE CONNECTION MODE:
‚Ä¢ How it works: Connects to external semantic model (Analysis Services)
‚Ä¢ Performance: Depends on external model performance
‚Ä¢ DAX support: Limited to what's defined in external model
‚Ä¢ Limitations: Cannot modify data model in Power BI
‚Ä¢ Refresh: Real-time (no refresh needed)
‚Ä¢ Best for: Enterprise semantic models, centralized modeling

DECISION MATRIX:
‚Ä¢ Choose IMPORT for: Performance, full functionality, most use cases
‚Ä¢ Choose DIRECTQUERY for: Real-time data, large datasets, limited model size
‚Ä¢ Choose LIVE CONNECTION for: Centralized modeling, enterprise scenarios

HYBRID APPROACH: Use composite models to combine Import and DirectQuery tables in the same model for optimal flexibility."
