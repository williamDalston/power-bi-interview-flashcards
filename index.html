        <h3>Tell me about yourself...</h3>
        <p class="big">"I'm someone who gets excited about solving real problems with data. My background is in Business Economics, so I always think about the business impact first—what's the problem we're trying to solve? I've spent the last six years helping organizations move from manual, time-consuming processes to automated, reliable systems. For example, I helped one non-profit cut their quarterly reporting from two weeks down to a single day. That's the kind of impact that gets me up in the morning."</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Why AGR? / Why this role?</h3>
        <p class="big">"What really drew me to AGR is the mission—helping government agencies modernize their systems. I've seen firsthand how outdated processes can hold back organizations from serving their communities effectively. This role feels like a perfect match because it combines my technical skills with work that actually matters. I'm excited about the opportunity to help government clients make better decisions through better data, and I think my experience with both the technical and business sides would be valuable here."</p>

      <h2>Real Stories That Matter</h2>
      <div class="grid g2">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>The Non-Profit That Was Drowning in Excel</h3>
          <p>I worked with a non-profit that was spending two weeks every quarter just putting together donor reports in Excel. The staff was frustrated, and they were missing opportunities because the data was always outdated. I helped them move to Power BI, built a system that automatically pulled data from their donor database, and created dashboards that updated in real-time. Now they can generate those same reports in about an hour, and they actually used the better data to secure 20% more funding. The executive director told me it was like giving them their time back.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>When Data Quality Was Keeping Everyone Up at Night</h3>
            <p>I joined a company where they had data scattered across five different systems, and nobody trusted any of it. Every time they needed to make a decision, they'd spend days trying to figure out which numbers were right. I spent time understanding their business processes, then built automated data quality checks and a single source of truth. The CFO told me it was the first time in years they could make decisions with confidence, and it cut their audit prep time by 40%.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Making the Impossible Possible at Waste Management</h3>
          <p>At Waste Management, they had a team of people manually checking routes every day using Excel spreadsheets. It was taking them 15 hours a week just to validate that everything was working correctly. I built an automated system that could spot problems before they became issues, and created dashboards that showed exactly what was happening in real-time. The operations manager said it was like having a crystal ball, and they improved their route efficiency by 10% while saving all that manual work.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
            <h3>When Teachers Finally Started Using Their Data</h3>
            <p>I worked with a K-8 school where they had all this student data, but the teachers never looked at it because it was too complicated or not relevant to their daily work. I sat down with them to understand what they actually needed to know, then built simple dashboards that showed exactly that. I also spent time training them on how to use it. Now they check their dashboards every morning, and the principal told me it became central to their successful $500,000 grant application. The teachers actually thanked me for making data useful for them.</p>

      <h2>Questions They Might Ask</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p><span class="q">Experience with Power Platform (Apps/Automate)?</span> "I've used Power Automate for things like sending alerts when data changes or creating approval workflows. I also work with SharePoint permissions and document management. I'm comfortable with the workflow logic because I've done similar automation work with Python, and I'm really excited to dive deeper into the Power Platform ecosystem."</p>
        <p><span class="q">How would you handle a Tableau to Power BI migration?</span> "I've actually done this before. The key is not to just copy what they have, but to understand what they're really trying to accomplish. I start by looking at their data model and see how we can make it better—usually that means a cleaner star schema that performs better. Then I work with the users to make sure the new reports actually solve their problems better than the old ones did. It's about making it faster and more reliable, not just different."</p>
        <p><span class="q">How do you ensure data quality?</span> "This is something I take really seriously. I start by understanding their data sources and building automated checks right into the process. I use Power Query to profile the data, then build validation rules that catch problems before they become issues. I also like to create a 'data health' dashboard so users can see if there are any concerns. The goal is to catch problems early and make sure people trust the data they're using."</p>
        <p><span class="q">Clearance?</span> "I'm a U.S. citizen and I understand this role requires Public Trust eligibility. I'm fully prepared to go through that process. I've worked with sensitive data before—FERPA-compliant student data—so I understand the importance of security and proper documentation. I take data security very seriously."</p>
